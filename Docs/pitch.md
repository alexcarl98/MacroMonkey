# Project Pitch

### 1. State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
My goal is to empower those new to health and wellness, who often feel overwhelmed by the complexities of nutritional tracking. The aim is to bring ease in building healthy habits and mindfulness towards what we eat everyday in a simplified, engaging, and non-intimidating platform. Our application will help users remain present-focused, offering them the tools to manage their dietary goals with ease and confidence, thereby making health tracking an accessible part of their daily routine.

### 2. State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered
During our preliminary ideation, we considered several solutions to address the needs of our target audience:
- **A Simplified Macronutrient Tracking App (MacroMonkey)**: Focusing on ease of use, quick food logging, and immediate feedback on nutritional intake.
- **A Community-Driven Food Blog**: Where users can exchange recipes, tips, and support each otherâ€™s health journeys.
- **A Gamified Meal Planning App**: Designed to make meal preparation fun and tailored, encouraging users to stick to their dietary goals through rewards and personalized suggestions.
Each solution was designed to tackle specific aspects of health management, from simplification and community support to engagement through gamification.

### 3. State the final app idea that your team has decided to do
After thorough analysis of the needs of my target audience, I've decided to proceed with the Macronutrient Tracking App, named MacroMonkey. This app idea was selected because it best meets the primary requirements of my target audience for simplicity and immediacy. MacroMonkey will simplify the tracking process with a user-friendly interface, incorporate gamification to motivate users, and provide visual tools to track progress and create habit building. This approach not only supports beginners in nutritional management but also integrates seamlessly into their daily lives, making health tracking a positive and straightforward experience.
