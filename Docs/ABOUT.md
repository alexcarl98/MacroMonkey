### Audience
January Comes around, and everyone swears they're going to change their habits. They're going to start eating healthier, being more active, whatever it may be. However, it always seems that these things often don't work out. 
- One reason people lose interest is because it's difficult to set a goal for yourself. It's difficult to figure out what it is that you want to look like

- I considered several audiences including fitness enthusiasts, long-term dieters, and health beginners. Ultimately, I settled on targeting individuals who are new to health and wellness tracking and often struggle with consistency in maintaining health goals. 
- This choice was driven by the understanding that the prospect of a long health journey can be daunting. 
- My application focuses on simplicity and immediate engagement, designed to help users stay present and motivated without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of health management.
