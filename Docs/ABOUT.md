### Description
MacroMonkey is a macronutrient tracking app that allows users to track their daily macronutrient intake with the foods that they eat on the day to day.
Beyond this, MacroMonkey is beginner friendly and encourages habit building with it's calendar profile. 


### Audience

- I considered several audiences including fitness enthusiasts, long-term dieters, and health beginners. Ultimately, I settled on targeting individuals who are new to health and wellness tracking and often struggle with consistency in maintaining health goals. 
- This choice was driven by the understanding that the prospect of a long health journey can be daunting. 
- My application focuses on simplicity and immediate engagement, designed to help users stay present and motivated without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of health management.
